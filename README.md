> you are your dotfiles.

Dotfiles here are being managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)â€“a symlink farm manager, useful for automatically (and safely) linking your dotfiles folder into your home directory.

### How to use:

install stow

    brew install stow

enter the dotfiles directory

    cd dotfiles

install the zsh settings

    stow zsh

install zsh settings for the root user

    sudo stow zsh -t /root

uninstall tmux

    stow -D tmux

install vim ignoring .DS_Store

    stow --ignore ".DS_Store" vim

etc, etc, etc...
